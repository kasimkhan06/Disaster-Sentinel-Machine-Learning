### CAMELS-IND attributes/forcings history
-------------------------------------------
--------------------------
Version 2.2: March 2025
--------------------------
Major changes/additions:
- Updated streamflow observations: CAMELS-IND now includes 242 catchments with streamflow observations for more than 30% of the period between 1980 and 2020.
Minor changes:
- Minor correction to the forcing column headings for 'evap_canopy (kg/m²/s)' and 'evap_surface (kg/m²/s)': the units have been updated to (mm/day).
- Corrections made to the gauge_id mapping for basin codes 12 and 15.


--------------------------
Version 2.1: October 2024
--------------------------
Data described in revised ESSD paper - 
Major changes/additions:
- The dataset name "CAMELS-INDIA" has been changed back to "CAMELS-IND" to align with the naming convention of other CAMELS datasets.
- A Python script file “filter_catchment.py” is added to filter-out the subset of the dataset based on flow data availability.
- "CAMELS_IND_Catchments_Streamflow_Sufficient.zip" contains a subset of 228 catchments with observed streamflow data available for more than 30% of the duration between 1980 and 2020.


-------------------------
Version 2.0: August 2024
-------------------------
Data described in ESSD paper - 
Major changes/additions:
- The dataset name "CAMELS-IND" has beed changed to "CAMELS-INDIA".
- All forcing time series have been extended from 01/01/1980 to 31/12/2020.
- Two new forcings, "pet_gleam" and "aet_gleam", have been added.
- Several attributes have been added, including gauge elevation, mean drainage path slopes, asynchronicity, gini coefficient, base flow index, stream elasticity, slope of FDC, water table depth, and anthropogenic influence.
- Available observed streamflow time series has been added for all 472 watersheds for the period 01/01/1980 to 31/12/2020.
- Regionally trained LSTM model-predicted streamflow has been added for all 472 watersheds for the period 01/01/1980 to 31/12/2020.

Minor changes:
- Attribute files have been renamed to "camels_India_XXXX.csv"
